# Video Store
A simple C# console application that calculates and prints statement of a customer's charges at a video store.
Charges depend on the movie's pricing type and how long it is rented.
There are three kinds of movies: regular, kids and new releases.
In addition to calculating charges, the statement also computes frequent renter points, 
which vary depending on whether the film is a new release or not.

# Requirements
Currently the program is able to print plain text statement only.
Complete it to support printing of HTML statement.

* Report's heading must be wrapped in <h1> tag. 
* Report's footer must be wrapped in <footer> tag.
* Movie titles must be wrapped with <b> tag.
* New lines (\n) must be achieved by wrapping them with <p> tag.

The program must continue to compile without errors and do not break the current plain text behavior.
